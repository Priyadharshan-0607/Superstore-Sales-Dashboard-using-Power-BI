Proud to share my Future Interns – Task 1 as part of my internship journey!
📊 I developed a Superstore Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze sales and profit trends across different regions, categories, and sub-categories.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Dashboard:
✅ Overall Sales: 2.29M, Quantity: 38K, and Profit: 286K.
✅ Regional insights – West region leading with the highest sales and profit contribution.
✅ Profit distribution by Category – Furniture (50.79%), Office Supplies (42.77%), and Technology (6.44%).
✅ Sub-Category analysis highlighting top-performing items like Copiers, Phones, and Accessories.
✅ State-wise sales performance with California and New York as major contributors.
✅ Customer segmentation analysis across regions.

This project gave me practical experience in Power BI, data modeling, and business insights by exploring sales distribution, profitability drivers, and customer behavior. It helped me understand how dashboards can support data-driven decision-making in retail.

🙏 A special thanks to #FutureInterns for giving me this valuable opportunity to learn, explore, and grow in the field of Data Analytics & Business Intelligence.
